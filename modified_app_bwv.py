This ZIP file contains the results of the Folder Split Recommendation Tool analysis.

## Files Included:

1. **summary_table.csv**: Overview of all users and service accounts with file counts before and after splits.
2. **folder_splits.csv**: Detailed list of all recommended folder splits.
3. **recommendations.json**: Detailed recommendations in JSON format.
4. **service_account_assignments.csv**: Detailed mapping of folders to service accounts.

## How to Use These Results:

The recommendations suggest moving specific folders from users who exceed the threshold to service accounts.
Each service account is kept under the threshold to ensure optimal performance.

For implementation, follow these steps:
1. Review the summary table to understand the overall impact
2. Check the folder splits table for detailed recommendations
3. Implement the moves according to the recommendations
